CSCI 0300 Project 1 - Snake
===========================

## Design Overview:
None

## Collaborators:
Da-Young Kim

## Responsible Computing:
Who founded the Consortium? Who is represented among the current members, and 
how might that affect decisions being made for Unicode?

The Unicode Consortium was founded by engineers from Xerox and Appleâ€”Joe Becker,
Lee Collins, and Mark Davis. Among the current members are companies like Apple, 
Google, Amazon and Adobe, some educational bodies such as The University of 
California at Berkelely, and foreign companies such as Beijing Zhong Yi 
Electronics Co. and Wenlin. Furthermore, the Consortium is also composed of 
individual members of different ranks such as "Lifetime", "10 or More Years". 
etc.

Find a language that is not yet in Unicode, has only recently been supported 
(e.g., in the last 10 years), or is/was missing important characters. What 
is/was missing, and how does this affect the users of the language?

A langugage that is not yet in Unicode is the Loma language which is a language
used in Liberia and Guinea belonging to the family of Niger-Congo languages.
This affects users of the language because it prevents them from being able to
communicate with others in their native language over computers.
