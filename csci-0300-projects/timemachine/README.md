## Part 1

**Remarks (optional):** <!-- Answer here -->

## Part 2

### Q1 (Atari game)

Asteroids (1981)

I did have some difficulties understanding the controls at first, however,
Stella was easy to work with/well documented so I was able to figure it out.
I do not think Stella needs any additional documentation.


### Q2 (HW emulator assumptions)

When new architectures come along, hardware emulators either need to be updated,
they become obsolete, or they are replaced by new hardware emulators. This 
makes the idea of using hardware emulation as a method of software preservation
not so feasible because of the level of maintenance it requires. 

## Part 3

### Q3 (Comparing with other forms of preservation)

Here are the key points we came up with:
    -Both forms keep record of sentimental/monumental pieces

    -Keep artifacts/software that may be useful for the future

    -Research could be done on object/software in future

    -Whether additional efforts for preservation should be applied
        “Ethics in conservation can be viewed as one equilateral triangle, where
        each side is indispensable to its existence. The first side refers to 
        the recognition of what is to be conserved, the second to why it should 
        be conserved, and the third to how it should be conserved.”

    -Should be collaboratively decided through collection of people with diverse 
     backgrounds

    -Softwares is not tangible like other forms of preservation

    -Difficult to distinguish: binary, algorithms, source code

    -Preservation already underrepresented amongst certain demographics

    -A standard to check is whether or not pieces of software were utilized to
     hurt minority groups


### Q4 (Legal protections and obligation to pay)

* Individual response: 

Digital libraries should not have legal protections because they need to be held
accountable under a number of circumstances. 

First, digital libraries should not be protected if they fail to properly 
protect the software archives from falling into the hands of individuals who 
use it to do harm. If digital libraries and preservationists do not have 
adequate measures in place to protect the software archives they hold—such as 
proper access controls and authentication mechanisms—then legal protections are 
not warranted. Legacy software in the hands of individuals who may use it for 
malicious purposes, such as unauthorized distribution, hacking, or other illicit
 activities, will pose risks to software creators, copyright holders, and the 
 public.

Second, the widespread distribution of legacy software without proper 
authorization from software creators or copyright holders may be considered 
piracy. If digital libraries and preservationists distribute legacy software 
without obtaining proper permissions or licenses, it could infringe on 
intellectual property rights. Therefore, legal protections are not justified for
these digital libraries. Unauthorized distribution of software, even for 
preservation purposes, may undermine the rights of software creators or 
copyright holders, and could set a precedent that devalues intellectual 
property.

Lastly, software creators or copyright holders deserve reasonable compensation 
for their intellectual property. Digital libraries and preservationists should 
charge small fees so that software creators or copyright holders are fairly 
compensated. These small fees would serve to provide the software creators or 
copyright holders with royalties, similar to music artists, for the distribution
of legacy software.  Therefore, the value of the software is acknowledged and 
the rights of software creators or copyright holders are respected.


* Discussion with partner:

Bullets from our conversation:

    -Preservation should be protected legally but with limitations

    -Software should not be able to be widely distributed for free

    -Money would not go to the library

    -Relatively recent software should be free

    -Fees act as royalties for the programmers, similar to royalties for music 
     artists

    -Decisions on preservation should be decided by diverse ethics committee

    -Should be in communication to the owners/creators of the software

In conclusion, legal protections for digital libraries and preservationists for 
legacy software should be implemented, but with limitations, and certain 
software should come with a small fee attached. Legal protections for digital 
libraries are necessary to protect digital libraries against unfair litigation 
and to ensure diversity, equity, and inclusivity in the preservation process. 
For instance, it could be required by law that digital libraries have a diverse 
ethics committee that are protected from litigation from companies/software 
creators (with reason). Furthermore, reasonable compensation to software 
creators or copyright holders should be taken into account. Implementing small 
fees, similar to royalties, for the distribution of legacy software would ensure
the value of the software is acknowledged and the rights of software creators 
or copyright holders are respected, while relatively recent software may be 
made available for free. Balancing the interests of preservation with the 
rights of software creators and copyright holders is crucial in establishing a 
fair and sustainable approach to legacy software preservation.


### Q5 (Responsibilities of stakeholders)

In conclusion, the consensus is that both consumers and companies/software 
developers have respective responsibilities/roles to play in preserving digital 
content. For consumers, this includes ensuring software artifacts are not used 
for harm nor profit,  ensuring that they pass checks that warrant their access 
to the software, and ensuring that they hold digital libraries accountable for 
representing accurate and diverse software history. For companies/software 
developers, this includes the right to litigate (with good reason) for 
preservation attempts, demand royalties for software creators, and if public 
bodies are curating, the right to have a say in who curates. The logic behind 
these responsibilities has been detailed in prior responses. A collaborative 
approach that respects the rights and interests of both consumers and 
companies/software developers can ensure a balanced and ethical approach towards
digital content preservation.

### Q6 (Expensive taste vs public good)

* Individual response: 

Legacy software can be considered a public good due to its potential to 
propagate a ripple effect of good. Legacy software has the capacity to inspire 
future software development and programming. Additionally, It serves as a 
catalyst for innovation and creativity, as new insights can be drawn from past 
programs through fresh eyes. Lastly, legacy software can also be repurposed by 
underrepresented or underprivileged communities to give back and benefit said 
communities. Therefore, considering legacy software as a public good should 
impact our approach to software preservation.

To ensure responsible preservation of legacy software, proper protections should
be implemented to prevent consumer abuse, such as using it for profit or harm. 
This can be achieved through mechanisms such as background checks, request 
forms, and diverse ethics committees, as discussed in previous responses. 
Additionally, funding for software preservation efforts can come from various 
sources, including taxes, to ensure that the financial burden is shared among 
stakeholders. With that being said, this approach to funding has problems of its 
own.

By recognizing legacy software as a public good and implementing appropriate 
safeguards, we can strike a balance between preserving valuable software 
artifacts and preventing misuse. This approach can foster innovation, inspire 
future programmers, and promote inclusivity in software preservation efforts, 
benefiting both the public and the software development community as a whole.

* Response to partner: 

In response to my partner's point, there definitely is a concern with the equity
challenges that come with digital libraries, especially when certain softwares
come at a price. Only individuals/communities with the equity to afford the
resources that are required to access these softwares—such as a home computer 
and money to purchase legacy software—will be the ones using these libraries.
Consequently, this would put underrepresented or underprivileged communities at
a further disadvantage.

Additionally, there are many issues with funding digital libraries—especially
taxation. These conversations about funding digital libraries is sure to cause
political turmoil in some countries where conversations about money and taxes 
can be particularly charged.

With that being said, the solutions to these issues are critical to establishing
these digital libraries. I would argue that the pros outweigh the cons, so
finding the solution to these problems and establishing these digital libraries
has the potential to spark a new age of software development for humanity.
