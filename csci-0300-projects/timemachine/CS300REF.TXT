                    CSCI0300 WordPerfect 5.1 Guide

      This is an introductory reference manual for WordPerfect 5.1,
created by the CSCI0300: Fundamentals of Computer Systems staff.




WordPerfect 5.1 originated as a
DOS word processor in 1979,
developed by BYU CS Professor Alan Ashton and graduate student
Bruce Bastian for the Data General minicomputer system. WordPerfect
2.20 for IBM PC was released in 1982, with DOS support released in
1983 with WordPerfect 3.0. Its features were significantly more
advanced than its competitor WordStar, and eventually displaced it
to become the dominant player in the market.

Unfortunately, due to a delayed release on Microsoft Windows, the
release of MS Word quickly displaced WordPerfect to become the
dominant word processor, and the rest is history. WordPerfect does
remain a favorite among lawyers, due to its Reveal Codes feature,
rapid editing capabilities once the keystrokes were mastered, and
formatting prowess, especially in creating consistent and strictly-
formatted documents like Pleadings.




To start, F3 opens up the Help menu. Use this to search for any
commands that you may desire; if there's a feature you're looking
for, you'll probably find it here. The help menu will probably be
a frequent destination on your quest to figure out how to use this
archaic software.

Once you've gotten a feel for the software, you can start the
assignment:

                              ASSIGNMENT
Finding this documentation helpful, you want to save it for future
use. Unfortunately, opening DOSBox, mounting your C: drive, then
opening WordPerfect is a little too cumbersome; additionally, after
this process you begin to realize the fragility of emulation
software, and thus desire a more accessible, universal format:
ASCII.

      1) Convert this document into ASCII, and save it into a
      file named "cs300ref.txt". The command for saving as ASCII is
      in this footnote. (But how to edit/open the footnote? Check
      the help page!)
           a) If the keyboard shortcuts aren't working, make sure
           that you've enabled mod1 and mod2 on the special keys, as
           specified in the handout

      2) Search the help menu for 'Reveal Codes' and run that
      command. This will show the formatting codes that WordPerfect
      uses for formats like bold, underline, Italics, and more

      3) Once you have revealed codes, write the entirety of the
      secret code we provide, including the Reveal Codes of the
      entire line, into a file named "secret-code.txt"

                             Secret Code:
